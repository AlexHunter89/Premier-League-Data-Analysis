# Premier League Match Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Premier League match results from the 2006-2007 season to the 2023-2024 season. It serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate a wide array of foundational data analysis skills, from basic statistical concepts to more advanced techniques.

## Data

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `home_team`: The name of the home team.
- `away_team`: The name of the away team.
- `home_goals`: The number of goals scored by the home team.
- `away_goals`: The number of goals scored by the away team.
- `season`: The season in which the match was played.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights through visualizations and basic statistical analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new meaningful columns, such as goal difference and location.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Apply basic and advanced statistical techniques to understand the data better.

## Methods

### Data Cleaning

- Handling missing values
- Correcting data types
- Ensuring consistency in team names

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Calculating mean, median, and mode for goals
- Visualizing distributions of goals scored
- Analyzing trends over different seasons

### Feature Engineering

- **Goal Difference**: Create a column for the goal difference in each match.
- **Match Location**: Classify matches as home or away for each team.

### Statistical Analysis

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate measures of central tendency and dispersion.
- **Probability**: Analyze the probability distributions of goals scored.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conduct tests to determine statistical significance in goal patterns.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Assess the relationship between different variables.
- **Regression Analysis**: Apply linear regression to understand trends and make predictions.

## Tools

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For statistical modeling and machine learning.

## Results

The results of the analysis will provide insights into:

- Trends and patterns in goal scoring over the years.
- The impact of playing at home versus away.
- Predictive modeling based on historical data.
