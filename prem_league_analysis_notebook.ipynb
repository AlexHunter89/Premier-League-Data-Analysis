    "#### A Few Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see a few insightful things with these distribution plots. The first thing that I noticed was that the plot for the goals scored by the home team is noticeably different from the plot for the goals scored by the away team. We can see that, in general, the away team scores fewer goals than the home team. This makes sense intuitively but our plot gives us quantitative values that verify that logic. Later on we will explore this relationship in more detail to try to understand to what extent the location of a match affects the amount of goals a team might score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also took a look at the distribution for the total goals scored in each game. One conclusion we might draw from this plot is that it seems pretty rare to get a game with 0 goals scored. The majority of the games that occur will have at least 1 goal scored. It seems that most games will have between 2 to 3 goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think one possible insight we can draw from all of this data could be this: Generally, we can expect that at least 1 goal will be scored in any Premier League match and the team that is most likely to score that goal would be the home team. We can also make some inferences about the defensive strength of particular teams. For example, if team A plays away vs team B, and the match ends 0 - 0, it might suggest that team A has a rather strong defense. This is because it would be rare for a game to not feature at least 1 goal from the home team. So we might infer that the away team, team A, needed to be strong defensively to create such an outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Series Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's take a look at some trends over time. Since we already took a look at some of the variables I want to stick with those for now. We can make line graphs that display the average goals scored by the home team, away team, and the average total goals scored per game. This can give us an idea about whether or not goals are mostly consistent over time or if trend in a particular direction."

    "## Key Insight!!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you examine the plot showing the average goals scored by the home team and the away team, you may notice something interesting. During the 2020-2021 season, the home and away teams appeared to be much more evenly matched compared to other seasons. *This anomaly warrants further investigation!*\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what might have caused this, we need to consider any events or circumstances during that time period. This is where some Premier League knowledge becomes valuable. Any dedicated fan would recall that the 2020-2021 season was played in empty stadiums due to COVID-19. This provides a clear explanation for the unusual data point on the plot and strongly suggests that home fans do indeed provide an advantage to the home team. The absence of fans coincided with nearly even average goals scored by both teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight will be crucial in our next steps as we aim to build a simple model to predict game outcomes. Knowing that there is a significant advantage to playing at home, we can adjust the model's parameters to account for the match location.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also note that the most recent season was the highest-scoring season in terms of goals per game by far. This introduces a bit more uncertainty about the upcoming season. We might interpret this as a sign that the next season could also see more goals per game than many of the previous seasons. Alternatively, we might consider the 2023-2024 season an outlier and expect the 2024-2025 season to be more in line with previous seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding some new features\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the reason for creating this project in the first place was to establish a foundation on which I can build a predictive model for Premier League games. With this in mind, I want to create a few additional features. These features will use a formula to predict the number of goals a particular team might score against another. We will have many decisions to make when developing these features. Testing, experimenting, and adjusting them will be key to creating an effective predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep it brief for now, the features I want to create will use a mathematical formula based on each team's average goals scored and conceded at a particular location—home or away—to estimate the goals each team will score, thereby predicting the outcome of the match."
